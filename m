Hi Valent,

thank you for your interest and sorry for the late reply. The time before=20
Christmas is usually a bit hectic ...

I would suggest to look into the "gluon" Freifunk Firmware [1], including t=
he=20
batman-adv parameters made there. There are setups with a couple of hundred=
=20
nodes, although some sparsely connected over cities. Those setups have been=
=20
used and tested for a long time on different types of hardware.

A few general suggestions for tuning for those scenarios are:

* set up a high multicast rate, at least 12 MBit/s, perhaps 24 or more. You=
=20
will trade scalability with range

* choose a higher than default OGM interval, e.g. 5 seconds instead of 1=20
second. This makes batman-adv reaction time slower, but helps scaling with=
=20
many nodes. Each node would repeat any other nodes OGM messages, which resu=
lts=20
in O(N^2) OGM messages per interval.

* if you don't need encryption (SAE), turn it off. SAE by default does a pe=
er-
to-peer handshake, which can kill a dense network with many participants in=
=20
one place, if everyone wants to handshake with everyone else at the same ti=
me.

There are a few more things (e.g. reducing basic rates) which you may find =
in=20
the gluon firmware and other places.=20

As you can see, some of those suggestions are more Wi-Fi layer specific tha=
n=20
batman-adv specific, and would help with other protocols (e.g. babel) as we=
ll.=20
=46rom my experience with network simulators/emulators, you may verify prot=
ocol=20
specific behavior (e.g. number of messages, failover time) to some extent. =
But=20
testing Wi-Fi specific scaling effects like failing SAE handshakes, effects=
 of=20
multicast rates, etc is rather hard - even if you use emulators based on=20
mac80211_hwsim or so which partially emulate 802.11. For those experiments,=
=20
it's best to actually set up 10-20 devices ...

Cheers,
        Simon

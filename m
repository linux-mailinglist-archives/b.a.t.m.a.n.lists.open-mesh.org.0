Correct, the throughput override is a static value and does not adjust to a  
changing environment. On wireless interface the estimated throughput would be 
adjusted as the nodes move away from each other (batman-adv is able to read 
estimated throughput values from the WiFi driver).

Exactly, the throughput override does not consider anything other than the 
configured value.

It seems you are attempting to simulate a wireless environment using wired 
devices. Wired devices typically can not "move away" from each other, hence 
you are running into this issue with your simulation approach. 

Maybe mac80211 hwsim is an option for you? I've never used it, so can't 
provide specific suggestions.

Have you considered testing on a wireless testbed?

Your question isn't entirely clear to me. As a first step, you'd have to rebase 
the tp meter patches to work on your chosen batman-adv version. How much work 
that might be is hard to ascertain without trying it.

Cheers,
Marek

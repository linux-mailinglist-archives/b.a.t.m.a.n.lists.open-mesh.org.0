Hello Everyone!

I want to present to the community my idea about spreading static ipv4 routes between mesh nodes.

So, it is my first project in C, before I only have an experience in bash. I know, it might have some weird methods (first painting cannot be good), but I am trying my best.

You can see what I suggest on my github page: https://github.com/nickbash11/raat , there you will find comprehensive information about what and how.

It just tries to recap the "community" mode in BMX6/BMX7 but with ALFRED. For now I test it between some virtualbox machines with OpenWRT 18/19. This time I do not have hardware resources (routers) to test it on the real network :(

All my devices are busy with qMp and I want to try some "pure" in the future, but I really used to see that each node has its own network behind it.

Maybe, I have invented a bicycle... don't no, anyway, check me out.

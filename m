Correct ought to be PT_ab * LT_bc / (PT_ab + LT_bc)

Yes good point will add appropriate checks for that and the other
possible integer overflow if this RFC goes further.

No good catch thanks. I can think of a way to fix that but it would
need additionnal info in the OGM to store current half duplex link
speed (maybe to add a TVLV for that). So let's first see if the idea
seems sound enough to go further.

On a side note, the current implementation also has its own flaws for
this scenario. Let's say you consider Orig0 to Orig3 instead and packets
will also go from Orig1 to Orig3 directly instead of bouncing on Orig2.

I don't know how that would behave on setup that does not have airtime
fairness changes integrated, if you think the current dividing by two
approach is better maybe this can be made a configurable option but that
could be tricky ?

For 11s, I have also run tests using mesh points instead of AP/STA and I
have measured similar results.

This, I have hard time figuring out how MLO would play along with
B.A.T.M.A.N-Adv integration. Unfortunately right now I have no way
to experiment that yet. IIUC the link would be a mix between half and
full duplex, and this would probably complicate things a bit.

Thanks a lot for your review.

Hello,

I wanted to follow up on my previous message. I did not see any replies,=20
so I hope it is ok to share one concrete finding from recent testing in=20
case it helps the discussion.

To move beyond purely theoretical arguments, I have been running large=20
scale tests using meshnet lab
https://github.com/mwarning/meshnet-lab

The main reason for choosing it is that it allows replaying real world=20
community network topologies, including Freifunk graphs, instead of=20
relying on synthetic grids or ideal meshes. This makes it easier to=20
observe behaviour under sparse, asymmetric, and imperfect conditions=20
that are closer to what actually gets deployed.

One interesting observation so far is that results can vary=20
significantly depending on how nodes are brought up and how control=20
plane load interacts with the topology. In other words, the same=20
protocol on the same topology can behave very differently depending on=20
timing, churn, and scale effects, even when the underlying links are=20
identical. This was not obvious to me before testing at this scale.

I am curious whether others here have used meshnet lab or similar=20
namespace based emulation tools for BATMAN adv testing, and if so,=20
whether your observations matched real deployments closely, or if there=20
are known caveats when interpreting the results.

Any feedback or pointers would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Valent

Subject Restarting MeshPoint =E2=80=93 seeking advice on routing for=20
crisis/disaster scenarios

>Hi everyone,
>
>My name is Valent Turkovic.
>
>Between 2015 and 2018 I ran the MeshPoint project =E2=80=93 a simple, rugg=
ed Wi-Fi hotspot designed to work in very tough conditions.
>
>During the refugee crisis in Croatia we deployed these devices in camps an=
d transit centers, providing internet connectivity for humanitarian organiz=
ations such as the Red Cross, UNICEF, IOM, Greenpeace, and many smaller NGO=
s. Through these deployments, more than 500,000 people were able to stay co=
nnected. The same system was also used in flood response and other emergenc=
y situations. The project received the =E2=80=9CBest Humanitarian Tech of t=
he Year=E2=80=9D award at The Europas in 2016.
>
>Unfortunately, financial constraints forced me to pause the project after=
 2018. It was entirely self-funded, and the prolonged stress eventually led=
 to long-term health issues.
>
>Over the years I stayed in contact with first responders and field teams f=
rom organizations such as WFP, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and various NGOs. The =
feedback has remained consistent: when disasters strike, whether earthquak=
es, floods, or large-scale displacement, teams still struggle to bring up r=
eliable communications quickly. What they need most is a mesh network that=
 works within minutes, not hours or days, and that continues operating on ba=
ttery power when infrastructure is down.
>
>I am fully aware that in active conflict zones Wi-Fi can be jammed or rest=
ricted, for example due to drone countermeasures. However, there are many o=
ther scenarios where Wi-Fi mesh remains extremely valuable: evacuation cent=
ers, field hospitals, temporary shelters, flood-affected villages, and coor=
dination points for responders. In these environments, fast, robust, and ea=
sy-to-deploy networking makes a very real difference for coordination, fami=
ly contact, and medical or logistical data sharing.
>
>Because of this, I am now restarting the project as MeshPoint V2. The focu=
s is updated hardware, improved battery life, and even simpler deployment,=
 while keeping the original goal: crisis response and off-grid or underserve=
d communities.
>
>In the original MeshPoint we used Babel. This was largely driven by practi=
cal constraints at the time: our deployment tooling was based on Nodewatche=
r, which was Babel-only. Technically, Babel served us very well. It converg=
ed fast, was reliable, and worked nicely for small to medium-sized networks=
.
>
>At the same time, I am well aware that many community networks and real-wo=
rld mesh deployments successfully used batman-adv, often through Gluon or c=
ustom firmware builds. In larger, more dynamic, or highly mobile topologies =
typical for crisis scenarios, the layer-2 approach and seamless mobility p=
roperties of batman-adv are very attractive, especially when nodes are freq=
uently moved, powered on and off, or replaced in the field.
>
>For MeshPoint V2 I am evaluating batman-adv and would appreciate insights=
 on the following aspects, specifically in the context of crisis and emergen=
cy deployments:
>
>Behaviour at larger scale in real deployments
>In crisis scenarios networks often start small but can grow quickly as mor=
e nodes are deployed by different teams or organizations. We are interested =
in how batman-adv behaves when scaling to hundreds or more nodes in non-id=
eal, real-world conditions, without centralized planning and with limited a=
bility for on-site tuning.
>
>Performance in sparse or highly mobile topologies
>Nodes in the field are frequently moved, turned off, replaced, or temporar=
ily isolated. Vehicles, backpacks, and mobile command posts constantly chan=
ge network topology. We are looking for practical experience with how well=
 batman-adv handles frequent topology changes, intermittent links, and spars=
e node placement without requiring constant manual intervention.
>
>Suitability for battery-powered and intermittently connected nodes
>Many nodes run on battery for long periods and may sleep, reboot, or disap=
pear entirely when power is lost. Low overhead, predictable behaviour, and=
 fast recovery after reconnect are essential. We are particularly interested =
in any known trade-offs between routing performance, control traffic, and=
 power consumption in such environments.
>
>If there is existing work, documented limitations, field experience, or de=
sign guidance relevant to these constraints, pointers would be greatly appr=
eciated. The goal is to build a system that field teams can deploy and rely =
on under stress, without requiring deep networking expertise on site.

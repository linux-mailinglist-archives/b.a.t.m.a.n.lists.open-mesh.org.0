Hello,

The local organization team is proud to announce that this year's
Battlemesh will be held near Paris, from 8 to 14 July!

The event aims to bring together people from across the globe who are
interested in community networks, including wireless mesh network
technologies, fiber infrastructure, Do-It-Yourself Internet Access
Providers, and more generally how to create and maintain a thriving
community of people involved in building their own networks.

We envision 7 days full of expert presentations, practical workshops,
late-night hacking sessions, and fruitful discussions: whether you are a
mesh networking enthusiast, community networking activist, protocol
developer, or have an interest in networking in general, come and join us!=

What
=3D=3D=3D=3D

We will have organized talks, workshops and discussion panels on community
networks and wireless mesh networks.  There will also be more informal
activities: cooperative hacking, self-organized projects, and (we hope)
delightful conversations!

A first draft of the schedule (handle with care!) is available here: https:=

We invite participants to propose workshops, talks or panel discussions
relating to network infrastructure in general, how it can be built and
operated as a common, and how to sustain a community around networking.

We welcome contributions that broadly address these questions from any of
several perspectives: technical, organisational, economical, regulatory,
juridical, political.

Deadline: 10 May 2019, now extended to June 7th!

Hi Martin,

I've discussed this with my co-maintainer Sven, but we will most likely not=
=20
adopt this change to batman-adv unless we find a really good use case or re=
ason=20
why this change should be made - as I wrote earlier, changing the originato=
r=20
timeout is not really required for most use cases, and even your use case c=
an=20
be solved differently. We try to keep the knobs in batman-adv/batctl minima=
l to=20
avoid that people shoot themselves in the foot.

Therefore, I would actually recommend to not make this patch, at least not =
for=20
upstream. If you need this for your own setup, then fine, but just hardcodi=
ng=20
the change in the source code or use the application-level method we discus=
sed=20
is probably better.

=46or contributions we have a page [1] describing what we expect and how pa=
tches=20
should be made. But again, I would suggest to spend the effort on something=
=20
else. :)

Thank you,
        Simon

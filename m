Ah nice! I remember the name nodewatcher from WLAN Slovenija, although I mu=

admit I haven't used nodewatcher so far. I think Mitar and others were talk=
ing=20
about it in the past ... Since battlemesh in croatia is coming up for 2026,=
=20
now is a good time to revive. :) We might have met in Battlemesh v8 in=20
Maribor, but I must admit, my memory is a bit blurry ...

OK, that's interesting. Gluon is also made for simplicity, you can get away=
=20
with just flashing the firmware and no further configuration. However, typi=
cally=20
you may want to enter the setup mode to set coordinates and a name of your =
AP,=20
though. IPs/subnets are automatically assigned from a centralized VPN serve=
r.=20
Either way, keeping it simple is definitely a good idea.

There are a few mechanisms in batman-adv, such as DAT (distributed ARP tabl=
es)=20
and multicast extensions to keep traffic at an acceptable limit. There are =
also=20
some changes to only send broadcasts only once on VPN links, or omit re-
broadcasts entirely those links.

However, the general scaling issues still apply. Therefore, gluon applies a=
=20
few parameters as outlined in my last mail. Hundreds of nodes are possible=
=20
(we've operated ~300 in our local Freifunk community), but with those numbe=
rs=20
there is quite a lot of "background" noise. Since we had a few slow DSL lin=
ks=20
within our VPN servers, we saw a bottleneck there already ...

In our Freifunk community, we segment into smaller domains (per city/town),=
=20
and I think others do the same - we are targeting up to ~100 -150 nodes per=
=20
segment.

Gluon also applies various firewall rules to avoid service discovery (e.g.=
=20
Avahi), Multicast DNS, etc over the mesh network, which are often way too=20
chatty with a few hundreds or even thousands of users.

We use a couple of VPN servers which run DHCP with different subnet per seg=
ment=20
(e.g. per town/city). Subnets are connected with each other using layer 3=20
routing on those VPN servers. We use bird to for the IP routing part, and G=
RE=20
tunnels to connect to our upstream Internet.

That I can't answer, maybe someone else has experience. :) Setting up the=20
layer 3 network requires quite a bit of engineering I would say.

Those answers were mostly around gluon and our local Freifunk network=20
(Freifunk Vogtland [1]). Since this is open source, you can easily review a=
nd=20
perhaps adopt some parts for your case. Other gluon and Freifunk networks m=
ay=20
operate differently. Perhaps there are other mailing list readers who want =
to=20
chime in with other projects. :)

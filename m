It looks like this is an option which can break the mesh rather easily. Her=

some quotes from 2019-04-30/2019-05-01:

<marec> even the 'cautious' option drops everything except for IGMP and ICM=
Pv6
<marec> nobody has a clear picture what that $everything is
<marec> how does it help you if IGMP and ICMPv6 go through if all other mul=
ticast / broadcast is dropped ?
<marec> (because of too many mesh participants with multicast optimizations=
 disabled)
<T_X> with IGMP/ICMPv6 to always go through I hope we have the most basic t=
hings for IP-IP communication covered and unsucceptible to DoS cases you ha=
ve already outlined
<marec> T_X: how so ?
<marec> T_X: even considering your gluon case - how many nodes would you ne=
ed to update and have to enable mcast optimization to safely turn on nofloo=
d ?
<marec> as I recall, your meshes are all bridged together over vpns
<marec> with only 16 nodes not upgraded or mcast optimization disabled nofl=
ood will be permanently active
<marec> (or whatever your fanout value is)

<T_X> so even if no node were having the multicast optimizations enabled, t=
hen communication both on the intranet and to the internet would still work
<marec> that was not my point
<marec> I want to allow people to experiment with and use multicast in a va=
riety of undefined applications. <<< how do you want to get there ?
<marec> while noflood drops everything
<marec> (except for maybe IGMP and ICMPv6)
<T_X> ah. yes. in that case, such applications would not / would stop worki=
ng. but that's our current default case with basically filtering all/most m=
ulticast traffic except ICMPv6 via ebtables in Gluon

<marec> even standard DAT falls back to flooding, isn't it ?
<T_X> marec: yep
<marec> so, ARP does not work with noflood ?
<T_X> if no ARP response in x milliseconds (250ms I think?) then it will fl=
ood the ARP request
<T_X> marec: right


<marec> sounds to me the noflood will be pretty difficult to understand and=
 debug
<marec> how does a normal user understand when ARP works sometimes .. or ev=
en normal mcast apps work sometimes ?
<marec> how will that seeming randomness be distinguishable from normal pac=
ket loss ?
<T_X> yes. would at least need some thorough wiki page, I guess. *cough* :)
<marec> I am talking about user outside the gluon garden
<marec> sorry for pointing it out again but this noflood feature still feel=
s like a gluon tailored solution - assuming auto-updaters, mcast enabled, n=
o IPv4 or other things other than IPv6 with router advertisements


<ordex> my opinion is that I agree with T_X when he says "just add this pat=
ch to the Gluon repository for now"
<ordex> honestly, skb-marking is much better imho. way less prone to mesh-e=
xplosions and people (that have a thorough understanding of ARP, ICMPv6, IG=
MP, MLD and understand what batman-adv would do or not) can decide how to t=
reat such packets *externally* to batman-adv
<ordex> this is what how we use the client-isolation with skb-marking - the=
 dropping logic is implemented outside
<ordex> with a match on the skb-mark
<T_X> ok. and both the client-isolation and noflood skb->markings would ful=
lfil a kind of similar purpose - that is preventing specific packets from r=
eaching $destination, which could not be fullfilled with netfilter alone, r=
ight?
[...]
<ordex> the reason for the skb-marking is to have something to match packet=
s against. In the client isolation case the knowledge about what to drop wa=
s inside batman-adv, thus we needed a way to "export" this knowledge



I would guess that you can also do something like this using ebtables + tc=
=20
filter. Even with (tc) eBPF... since eBPF seems to be the miracle solution=
=20
for everything these days.

Kind regards,
	Sven

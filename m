For Gluon the situation was that IGMP+MLD is filtered via ebtables,
because it otherwise would have a significant broadcast overhead.

For batman-adv the situation was that IGMP+MLD got flooded so far.

With this option a node would only send it to detected multicast
routers instead.

I would like to enable layer 3 IPv6 multicast routing between Freifunk
communities / Gluon domains. But without the broadcast flooding
overhead, to stay somewhat scalable.

And the reason why I would want to do layer 3 multicast routing:
Right now multicast has a chicken & egg problem: There aren't many
transmitters or receivers for it (other than ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery or mDNS).
However one strength of multicast lies in the significantly
increased throughput when there are many simultaneous receivers.

So I'm hoping that while at Freifunk Lübeck with its ~200 nodes /
~200 clients domain I'm basically the only one using it that
if there were all 40'000 Gluon nodes connected on layer 3 that
the chances of a multicast stream being received by multiple
people would significantly increase. Also more multicast content
should then become available for everyone.

Ok, maybe I should have written that more directly in the first
two sentences.

Right, in most cases I wouldn't suggest people to enable it. As
can be seen in the wiki page examples it is not trivial. I would
only suggest enabling it in setups where you have thoroughly
checked your use-case against the ones in the wiki. And then only
if you care about layer 3 multicast routing in the first place.

I don't have any future ABI changes for this in mind. This was
more thought as a warning that the list of examples in the wiki
might not be exhaustive. I could only find one setup where
enabling this option would not work, but despite having spent
several days thinking about these scenarios I can't guarantee right now that
it's the only one. That's why I wanted to mark it as
experimental.

Yeah, it's a bit annoying that for IPv4 it was named IGMP and for
IPv6 it was then renamed to MLD even though the protocol is 99%
the same thing. I'm not sure if it would make sense to make two
separate knobs for IGMP and MLD? (I kind of more and more have the
stance that where "legacy IP" creates extra hassle to ignore it
where possible. And multicast with IPv4 is not as much fun as with
IPv6 anyway, where you have things like embedded RP etc.)

Hi everyone,

My name is Valent Turkovic.

Between 2015 and 2018 I ran the MeshPoint project =E2=80=93 a simple, rug=
ged Wi-Fi hotspot designed to work in very tough conditions.

During the refugee crisis in Croatia we deployed these devices in camps a=
nd transit centers, providing internet connectivity for humanitarian orga=
nizations such as the Red Cross, UNICEF, IOM, Greenpeace, and many smalle=
r NGOs. Through these deployments, more than 500,000 people were able to =
stay connected. The same system was also used in flood response and other=
 emergency situations. The project received the =E2=80=9CBest Humanitaria=
n Tech of the Year=E2=80=9D award at The Europas in 2016.

Unfortunately, financial constraints forced me to pause the project after=
 2018. It was entirely self-funded, and the prolonged stress eventually l=
ed to long-term health issues.

Over the years I stayed in contact with first responders and field teams =
from organizations such as WFP, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and various NGOs. =
The feedback has remained consistent: when disasters strike, whether eart=
hquakes, floods, or large-scale displacement, teams still struggle to bri=
ng up reliable communications quickly. What they need most is a mesh netw=
ork that works within minutes, not hours or days, and that continues oper=
ating on battery power when infrastructure is down.

I am fully aware that in active conflict zones Wi-Fi can be jammed or res=
tricted, for example due to drone countermeasures. However, there are man=
y other scenarios where Wi-Fi mesh remains extremely valuable: evacuation=
 centers, field hospitals, temporary shelters, flood-affected villages, a=
nd coordination points for responders. In these environments, fast, robus=
t, and easy-to-deploy networking makes a very real difference for coordin=
ation, family contact, and medical or logistical data sharing.

Because of this, I am now restarting the project as MeshPoint V2. The foc=
us is updated hardware, improved battery life, and even simpler deploymen=
t, while keeping the original goal: crisis response and off-grid or under=
served communities.

In the original MeshPoint we used Babel. This was largely driven by pract=
ical constraints at the time: our deployment tooling was based on Nodewat=
cher, which was Babel-only. Technically, Babel served us very well. It co=
nverged fast, was reliable, and worked nicely for small to medium-sized n=
etworks.

At the same time, I am well aware that many community networks and real-w=
orld mesh deployments successfully used batman-adv, often through Gluon o=
r custom firmware builds. In larger, more dynamic, or highly mobile topol=
ogies typical for crisis scenarios, the layer-2 approach and seamless mob=
ility properties of batman-adv are very attractive, especially when nodes=
 are frequently moved, powered on and off, or replaced in the field.

For MeshPoint V2 I am evaluating batman-adv and would appreciate insights=
 on the following aspects, specifically in the context of crisis and emer=
gency deployments:

Behaviour at larger scale in real deployments
In crisis scenarios networks often start small but can grow quickly as mo=
re nodes are deployed by different teams or organizations. We are interes=
ted in how batman-adv behaves when scaling to hundreds or more nodes in n=
on-ideal, real-world conditions, without centralized planning and with li=
mited ability for on-site tuning.

Performance in sparse or highly mobile topologies
Nodes in the field are frequently moved, turned off, replaced, or tempora=
rily isolated. Vehicles, backpacks, and mobile command posts constantly c=
hange network topology. We are looking for practical experience with how =
well batman-adv handles frequent topology changes, intermittent links, an=
d sparse node placement without requiring constant manual intervention.

Suitability for battery-powered and intermittently connected nodes
Many nodes run on battery for long periods and may sleep, reboot, or disa=
ppear entirely when power is lost. Low overhead, predictable behaviour, a=
nd fast recovery after reconnect are essential. We are particularly inter=
ested in any known trade-offs between routing performance, control traffi=
c, and power consumption in such environments.

If there is existing work, documented limitations, field experience, or d=
esign guidance relevant to these constraints, pointers would be greatly a=
ppreciated. The goal is to build a system that field teams can deploy and=
 rely on under stress, without requiring deep networking expertise on sit=
e.

Thank you for your time, and thank you to everyone who has contributed to=
 making mesh networking viable outside of labs and into real-world, high-=
stakes situations.

Best regards,
Valent Turkovic

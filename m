Ah I see, so you're entirely splitting the DHT from the local ARP cache.
Naming indeed makes sense now.

nah, I got it wrong. Your explanation above helped me clear the doubt.

 From what you are saying and (what I understand) this splitting is not 
only about the timeout, but it's a clear cut between "what we have in 
the DHT" and what we are collecting locally.

So splitting data structure makes a lot of sense to me.

With a flag, you should assume that a specific entry can either have or 
not the flag set.
With two tables, the same entry could technically exists in both and 
it'll be up to you decide how to handle the situation (without ambiguity 
in this case because you know exactly where each entry is coming from).

I feel you need to answer the above questions even with two tables. No?
The difference is that with two tables you have more information and 
don't need overwrite a DHT entry with a local one (and viceversa).

I think splitting is a good idea, not only because of the timeout, but 
also because it makes the state more clear.

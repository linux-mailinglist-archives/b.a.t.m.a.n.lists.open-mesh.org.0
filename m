Currently we schedule a broadcast packet like:

3x: [ [(re-)queue] --> for(hard-if): maybe-transmit ]

The intention of queueing a broadcast packet multiple times is to
increase robustness for wireless interfaces. However on interfaces
which we only broadcast on once the queueing induces an unnecessary
penalty. This patch restructures the queueing to be performed on a per
interface basis:

for(hard-if):
- transmit
- if wireless: [queue] --> transmit --> [requeue] --> transmit

Next to the performance benefits on non-wireless interfaces this
should also make it easier to apply alternative strategies for
transmissions on wireless interfaces in the future (for instance sending
via unicast transmissions on wireless interfaces, without queueing in
batman-adv, if appropriate).

Changelog v3:

* changed all skb_clone() calls to skb_copy(), to move the
  skb_copy()->skb_clone() changes to extra commits with their own
  explanation

Changelog v2:

* fixed spelling of "unnecessary" in commit message (thanks Sven)
* removed now superflous kerneldoc for hard_iface in
  batadv_forw_packet_bcasts_left() (thanks Sven)
* removed delay check for queued (re)broadcasts in
  batadv_forw_bcast_packet_if(): the only case where a delay is set
  for this function is for a delayed, DAT fallback ARP Request from
  this node, then however num_bcasts will be >=3D1, too, and the fallback
  ARP Request will be scheduled anyway

Hi Simon,

Thank you very much for the detailed reply and the practical=20
suggestions. The timing is no problem at all =E2=80=93 I completely underst=
and=20
how busy things get around the holidays.

I should mention some background: I was an active member of wlan=20
slovenija and the Otvorena mre=C5=BEa (Open Network) project in Croatia. We=
=20
are now restarting nodewatcher =E2=80=93 our system for node monitoring and=
=20
firmware generation for community networks in Croatia and Slovenia.

Our approach is a bit different from Gluon. Instead of a unified=20
firmware image, nodewatcher generates custom firmware per node with all=20
parameters pre-configured: subnets, channel assignments, interface=20
roles, etc. This lets us handle complexity on the backend so that end=20
users just flash the image and everything works =E2=80=93 no wizard, no=20
configuration choices that might confuse home users. We will certainly=20
look at Gluon's technical choices for batman-adv tuning, but we prefer=20
this 'keep it simple' deployment model.

Some history: when building the mesh networks in Slovenia and Croatia,=20
we started with OLSR. It worked well initially, but once we crossed ~300=20
nodes we hit serious scaling limits. Around that time (6-7 years ago) we=20
were aware that Freifunk communities in Germany were also experiencing=20
scaling issues with batman-adv, so we chose to migrate to Babel instead.=20
Babel served us well and we never looked back.

Now, as we restart MeshPoint and consider protocol options again, I am=20
genuinely curious:

1. How has batman-adv addressed the scaling problem over the past 7=20
years? Since it operates at L2, there is inherently more broadcast=20
traffic. Do larger Freifunk networks segment into smaller batman-adv=20
domains connected via something else, or has the protocol itself=20
improved to handle hundreds of nodes in a single domain?

2. Are there established patterns for combining batman-adv with overlay=20
networks or L3 routing? For example, batman-adv for local mesh segments=20
with BGP or Babel connecting segments at gateways?

3. For mobile crisis deployments where topology changes constantly, is=20
pure batman-adv still recommended, or do experienced operators use=20
hybrid approaches?

These are deeper architectural questions =E2=80=93 I understand if the answ=
ers=20
are 'it depends' or require longer discussion. Any pointers to=20
documentation, mailing list threads, or real-world deployment writeups=20
would be very helpful.

Thank you again for your time and the work you and the team have put=20
into batman-adv over the years.

Best regards,
Valent

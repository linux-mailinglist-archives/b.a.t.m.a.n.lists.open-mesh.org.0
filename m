This means that your node has sent a LOOPDETECT packet. Those are sent out on 
the LAN to check if there is a loop somewhere which BLA couldn't resolve or 
where a misconfiguration happened. There are some scenarios which are not 
covered by BLA:

Hmm, that's strange indeed. Did you have good connection between all those 
devices? There is a certain "horizon", e.g. if you have many weak links in a 
daisy chain the the OGMs are dropped before they are reaching the end of the 
path.

Did you see node D in the originator table of node A?

We don't have an option to ignore nodes from a user perspective.

It's possible and perfectly fine if you have two meshes connected to the same 
LAN like this:

https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Bridge-loop-avoidance-Testcases#Two-meshes-connected-by-one-LAN

Just make sure that the meshes are properly disconnected and not rejoin from 
time to time (e.g. by having different SSIDs)

No, BATMAN V will not magically fix this.

bridge loop avoidance should be on as soon as you have any two nodes connected 
to the same LAN and mesh at one time.

I don't see why you need ap_isolation. This is for external stations which are 
connected to APs of the same mesh and shouldn't talk to each other.

I think we should work on your a - b - c - d chain and find out why a can't 
talk to d. That seems like the most obvious symptom.
